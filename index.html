          <h5 class="career">Software Engineer, July 2018 - Present</h5>
          <p>As a software engineer in a leading company for semiconductor production, my responsibilities mainly focus on designing and implementing new features to the machine using C++.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is a place where I embarked my journey as a software developer. By working under agile software development cycle (Scrum), I learnt to utilize version control system (Git & Bitbucket) and managed work with issue tracking tool (Jira). Throughout the journey, I have strengthened my foundation in OOP language and improved myself to write more maintainable code.
          <br>
          <br>
          Within a year, I had been appointed to handle an important project - Integration of Tape and Reel Project. It was a whole new process and it was being integrated in our machine for the first time. Working hard with hardware and electrical team, we managed to deliver tape and reel machine timely and won the project from customer. This achievement has hugely boosted my confidence and fulfilled my satisfaction. </p>

          <p>Intel was my first company where I started my career after completed my degree study.
          <br>
          <br>
          From mechatronics background and having limited knowledge in software, it was my first time learning about Linux environment. Always thinking how cool it is whenever I watched a hacker typing command line in a movie, finally I am able to act like one after learning some basic stuff!
          <br>
          <br>
          Being a graphics software validation engineer, I was exposed to some basic knowledge about graphics including display, media and 3D. Moreover, I managed to build automation scripts for automation testing purpose using Python language.</p>

          <h5 class="career">Internship, June 2016 - Sept 2016</h5>
          <p>I worked as a trainee in Willowglen for 3 months.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was involved in a supporting team to support in a LRT project. The project involved in the establishment of CCTV monitoring display for each stations in Ampang line LRT. I had applied what I learnt from university and assisted in drawing cable routing for each station by using AutoCAD which was then being approved by professional engineer. I was also involved in dealing with subcontractor and stock management in company's warehouse.
          <br>
          <br>
          To be frank, I did not gain much technical knowledge over here, but it was a good exposure to the industry.

          <h5 class="career">Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering, Sept 2013 - Sept 2017</h5>
          <p>This was the place where I gained my passion in engineering. I realized that the purpose of engineering school is not solely imparting knowledge of engineering, but to cultivate one to keep their curiosity and never stop finding the best solution for a problem.
          <br>
          <br>
          As mechatronics students, we need to learn various skills from different field including mechanical, electrical and electronics, software, IoT, artificial intelligent, etc... To be honest, we do not master a particular field as strong as those who only focus on one. Nevertheless, we are trained to be versatile and more adaptive to master any skills than others.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thanks for the four years, I am blessed and couldn't be grateful enough.
