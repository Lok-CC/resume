          <p>This is the place where my passion of engineering being implanted to my heart. I learnt that the purpose of engineering school is not teaching one the knowledge of engineering, but to cultivate one to keep their curiosity and never stop to find the best solution for a problem.

          <br>
          As mechatronics students, we need to learn various skills from different field including mechanical, electrical and electronics, software, IoT, artificial intellignet, etc... To be honest, we does not master a particular field stronger than student who only focus on one. Nevertheless, we have trained to be versatile and more adaptive to master any skills than others.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thanks for the four years, I am blessed and couldn't be grateful enough.
